## About

The [Chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) is a low level interpreted programming language.

Creating a Chip-8 interpreter is considered my most people as an entry project for anyone interested in building an emulator. Similar to a "hello world" is an entry program to anyone learning how to program.

This project is exactly this. It is a first a first attempt at figuring out how to build a program to emulate a different machine.

Most of the information for this emulator was gather from a [blog post by Tobias V. Langhoff](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/). The following pages were also used as reference:

A [repository by mirz](https://github.com/mir3z/) was used to download some ROMs to test the interpreter and to get a feel of how the games should run.
